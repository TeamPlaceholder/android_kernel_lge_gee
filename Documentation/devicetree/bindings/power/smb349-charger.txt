Summit smb349 battery charger

SMB349 is a single-cell battery charger. It can charge
the battery and power the system via the USB/AC adapter input.

The smb349 interface is via I2C bus.

Required Properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,smb349-charger".
- reg:				The device 7-bit I2C address.
- regulator-name		A string used as a descriptive name for OTG regulator.

Optional Properties:

- interrupts			This indicates the IRQ number of the GPIO
				connected to the STAT pin.
- qcom,chg-valid-gpio		GPIO which indicates the charger presence.
				This GPIO is connected to the SYSOK pin.
- qcom,fastchg-current-max-ma Fast Charging current in mA. Supported range is
				from 1000mA to 4000mA.
- qcom,chg-autonomous-mode	This is a bool property and it indicates that the
				charger is configured for autonomous operation and
				does not require any software configuration.
- qcom,disable-apsd		This is a bool property which disables Automatic
				power source detection (apsd). If this is set
				charger detection is done by DCIN UV irq.
- qcom,charger-disabled	This is a bool property which disables charging.

- qcom,reload-smb-config	This is a bool property to indicate if the
				smb register configuration needs to be reloaded
				when the charger is removed.
- qcom,bms-psy-name		This is a string and it points to the bms
				power supply name.

Example:
	i2c@f9967000 {
		smb349-charger@1b {
			compatible = "qcom,smb349-charger";
			reg = <0x1b>;
			interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
			interrupts = <48 0x0>;
			qcom,chg-valid-gpio = <&msm_gpio 13 0x00>;
			qcom,fastchg-current-max-ma = <3500>;
			qcom,chg-autonomous-mode;
			qcom,bms-psy-name = "bms";
		};
	};
