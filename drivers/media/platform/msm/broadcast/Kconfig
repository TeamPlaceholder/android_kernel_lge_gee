	---help---
	Transport Stream Packet Processor v2 is used to offload the
	processing of MPEG transport streams from the main processor.
	It is used to process incoming transport streams from TSIF or memory
	input, to supports use-cases such as transport stream live play,
	playback from memory and recording.
	This can also be compiled as a loadable module.
